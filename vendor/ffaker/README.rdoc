= ffaker

Fast Faker == Faker refactored, cleaner and faster.

= Faker

A port of Perl's Data::Faker library that generates fake data.

== Usage

  require 'ffaker'

  Faker::Name.name => "Christophe Bartell"

  Faker::Internet.email => "kirsten.greenholt@corkeryfisher.info"

== Ffaker / Faker

The only difference between faker and ffaker is that you need to

  gem install ffaker

and then

  require 'ffaker'

instead of "faker" with only one f.

The API is pretty much the same as before.

Fork it/ping me if you feel like adding more goodies to it.

== Faster? does it really matter ?

$ cat scripts/benchmark.rb

  # ...
  N = 10_000

  Benchmark.bm do |rep|
    rep.report("generating #{ N } names") do
      N.times do
        Faker::Name.name
      end
    end
  end

DISCLAIMER: I have no idea why I'm getting such bad numbers
for traditional faker on 1.9, but I'm not making this up.
Try it in your own machine, your mileage may vary!

== TODO

* Even though the API is pretty simple, better rdoc documentation would not hurt.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
